# Memory Card

This React application is a fun scoreboard game that allows users to display cards with images and informational text fetched from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It includes a score tracking system with a current score and a best score feature. The cards are displayed in a random order each time a user clicks on a card.
